# Neuro-Deep Fuzzy System

## Overview
The Neuro-Deep Fuzzy System is a hybrid system that combines neural networks and fuzzy logic for advanced decision-making and prediction tasks. This repository contains the implementation of the system, along with scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Integration of deep learning and fuzzy logic.
- Flexible architecture for multiple use cases.
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## Prerequisites
To run this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imashoodnasir/Neuro-Deep-Fuzzy-System.git
   cd Neuro-Deep-Fuzzy-System
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## File Structure
- `data/`: Directory for storing input datasets.
- `models/`: Contains pre-trained models and model architecture definitions.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model demonstration.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation
Place your dataset files in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data follows the expected format. For custom datasets, update the preprocessing scripts accordingly.

### 2. Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data for training:
```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/processed_data.csv
```

### 3. Training
Train the Neuro-Deep Fuzzy System by running:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --config configs/train_config.json
```

- Replace `configs/train_config.json` with your configuration file if required.
- Training parameters, such as epochs, batch size, and learning rate, can be adjusted in the configuration file.

### 4. Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py --model_path models/trained_model.pth --test_data data/test_data.csv
```

### 5. Running Jupyter Notebooks
For interactive exploration and demonstration, open the Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/demo.ipynb
```

## Configuration
All configurable parameters, such as dataset paths, training hyperparameters, and model settings, are stored in the `configs/` directory. Update the configuration files to suit your needs.

## Results
Results will be saved in the `results/` directory, including:
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Visualizations (if enabled)
